Comments to the code in this repo
When trying to solve the tasks in this repo i have taken som prerequisite

//these are:
1.
In the code i have purposely included some undefined variables and functions
these are linked to the dom-elements refered to in the task_for_interview.pdf 
for example: the "newDivElement" in task1 is ment to be the random element that 
gets appended to the dom 

2.
I have left a whole bunch of comments and some of my console.logs to try to explain my tought process and hopefully makes it a little bit easier for you to read my code

3.
There will be some spelling mistakes(hopefully not any critical typos that affect the code, but hopefully just typos and some badly written engish comments)


/////////////////
Happy code review! 
Thanks for the oportunity it has been fun!
Sebastian
